'''Input Format'''

There are two lines of input. The first line contains : the breadth of the parallelogram. The next line contains : the height of the parallelogram.

'''Constraints'''
-100 <= H <= 100
-100 <= B <= 100

'''Output Format'''

If both values are greater than zero, then the main method must output the area of the parallelogram.
Otherwise, print "java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.
